\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 That which was from the beginning—which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at, and our hands have touched—it is about the Word of life.
\v 2 Also, the life was made known, and we have seen it, and we bear witness to it. We are announcing to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and which has been made known to us.

\s5
\v 3 That which we have seen and heard we declare also to you, so you also will have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 
\v 4 Also, we are writing these things to you so that our joy will be complete.
\f + \ft Some older versions read, \fqa And we are writing these things to you so that your joy will be complete. \fqb  \f*

\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the one who is righteous.
\v 2 He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
\v 3 By this we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments.

\s5
\v 4 The one who says, "I know God," but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
\v 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly, it is in that person that the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him.
\v 6 The one who says he remains in God should himself also walk just as Jesus Christ walked.


\s5
\v 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know the truth.
\f + \ft Some other modern versions read, \fqa and you have all knowledge. \fqb Some older versions read, \fqa and you know all things. \fqb \f*
\v 21 I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and because no lie is from the truth.

\s5
\v 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist, since he denies the Father and the Son.
\v 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever acknowledges the Son also has the Father.

\s5
\v 24 As for you, let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in the Son and in the Father.
\v 25 And this is the promise he gave to us: eternal life.
\v 26 I have written these things to you about those who would lead you astray.

\s5
\v 27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you everything and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, remain in him.
\p
\v 28 And now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he appears, we will have boldness and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
\v 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born from him.

\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God, and this is what we are. For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him.
\f + \ft Some older versions leave out, \fqa and this is what we are. \fqb \f*
\v 2 Beloved, we are now children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is.
\v 3 Everyone who has this confidence about the future fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure.
